# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis using SQL (MySQL) 🍕

## 📌 Overview
This project presents an in-depth **SQL-based analysis** of pizza sales data to derive meaningful business insights. The dataset consists of multiple tables, including order details, pizza types, and sales records. By leveraging **MySQL**, we explore revenue trends, popular pizza choices, and order patterns to enhance business decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives
The primary goal of this project is to analyze pizza sales data to:
- 🔍 **Analyze Sales & Revenue**: Calculate total revenue, order frequency, and top-selling pizzas.
- 📊 **Identify Trends**: Determine peak order times, popular pizza sizes, and customer preferences.
- 📈 **Optimize Business Strategies**: Evaluate revenue distribution and inventory management for better decision-making.
- 🔢 **Advanced SQL Queries**: Use joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions for deeper insights.

## 🗂 Dataset
The dataset includes the following key tables:
- 🛒 **Orders** (`order_detail`, `order.csv`)
- 🍕 **Pizza Types** (`pizza_type`)
- 📦 **Pizzas** (`pizzas.csv`)
